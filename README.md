# Acmecrystal

You can build and run acmecrystal.

```
go build
```

Acmecrystal watches the acme log for any Crystal files being Put, and then reformats the file and reloads the window.
That's all it does. It's nice.

It still needs some more work to retain undo history.
For my current purposes of learning Crystal this is sufficient, but long term this will prove annoying.
